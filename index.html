      Baobab oil is a nutrient rich oil that comes from the seeds of the baobab
      tree. It is obtained by cold pressing the seeds and has a deep golden
      yellow color, a rich feel. In Africa, people call the baobab tree “the
      tree of life” and “pharmacy tree” because of its many uses, including for
      baobab oil.
