        Baobab oil is a nutrient rich oil that comes from the seeds of the
        baobab tree. It is obtained by cold pressing the seeds and has a deep
        golden yellow color, a rich feel. In Africa, people call the baobab tree
        “the tree of life” and “pharmacy tree” because of its many uses,
        including for baobab oil.
